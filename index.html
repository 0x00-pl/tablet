        <h1>How to locate a failure</h1>
        
            <p>This guide will help you find the reason your tablet doesn’t work under Linux
and who can help you fix it. You’ll need to know how to minimally use Linux
command line. This guide won’t hold your hand and will expect you to find some
things out by yourself. We’ll start from the bottom.</p>

<h2 id="computer-hardware">Computer hardware</h2>
<p>As unlikely as it sounds, it sometimes happens, and might be good to rule out.
Sometimes the USB host hardware in computers is faulty and your tablet might
experience intermittent disconnects or similar transient issues. To make sure
that is not the case, try the tablet on another machine, preferably a
different model or make, but with the same operating system. If it works
there, then the computer hardware is likely at fault and you need to repair or
replace it. Proceed to the next section if it still doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Don’t be worried if you can’t do this test. Such failures are rare and I think
I only saw them twice through all the history of the project.</p>

<h2 id="tablet-hardware">Tablet hardware</h2>
<p>Next thing you should do is check if your tablet works under Windows. If you
installed the required Windows drivers correctly and it still doesn’t work,
then that’s likely a hardware issue. To be extra sure try it on yet another
Windows machine, preferably with another Windows version.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a Windows machine handy, but have an install disc or image,
and an appropriate license, you can run it in a virtual machine under
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, <a href="https://virt-manager.org/">Virt-Manager</a> or similar, install the drivers, connect the
tablet from the host system using VM configuration, and test it.</p>

<p>If you have none of the above, then you can use your Linux system to talk to
the tablet directly and try to figure out if what it says makes sense.</p>

<p>First, find out the vendor and product IDs of your tablet, commonly
abbreviated to VID and PID, and represented as a pair of 4-digit hexadecimal
numbers with a colon in between. You can see each tablet having them on our
<a href="/tablets/">tablets</a> page. For example, <a href="/tablets/KYE_EasyPen_i405X/">KYE EasyPen i405X</a>
has VID:PID of 0458:5010, but e.g. all Huion tablets share the same VID:PID
of 256c:006e (in abuse of the USB standard).</p>

<p>To find the VID:PID of your tablet, simply disconnect it from your computer,
run <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsusb</code>, connect it again, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsusb</code> again, and then compare the outputs
and find the line which appeared in the second output - that’s your tablet.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ lsusb

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the example above, the new line corresponding to the tablet is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Bus 003 Device 006: ID 256c:006e  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It describes a Huion tablet. Note how there’s nothing after the VID:PID
(256c:006e). This is an extreme, but possible case, where the tablet doesn’t
report actual vendor or product name, which would have helped to identify it.
That’s why the ultimate method of finding your tablet in <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsusb</code> output is
comparing two outputs before and after plugging the tablet in.</p>

<p>Once you found your tablet VID:PID pair, you can run <code class="highlighter-rouge">usbhid-dump</code> to see what
the tablet says. Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo usbhid-dump -es -m &lt;VID:PID&gt;</code>, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;VID:PID&gt;</code> is
your tablet’s VID:PID pair. E.g. for the tablet VID:PID we found above the
command will be:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo usbhid-dump -es -m 256c:006e
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you start the command, it will begin listening to your tablet and
outputting the data it receives:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Starting dumping interrupt transfer stream

<p>The above is a very short excerpt of reports sent by a Huion Tablet in
response to its pen hovering above the drawing surface. Once you’re done
looking at the reports, press Ctrl-C to terminate usbhid-dump.</p>

<p>Deciphering everything the tablet sends can be hard and it isn’t really
necessary to find out if the tablet hardware works in general. Usually it is
sufficient to simply see if the tablet reports <strong>change</strong> in response to the
kind of input that you see not working. Remember also that numbers in the
reports are in little-endian format, e.g. the least significant byte comes
first (leftmost), followed by more significant bytes. So, a 32-bit hexadecimal
number 1234ABCD will be output as <code class="highlighter-rouge">CD AB 34 12</code>.</p>

<p>For the most frequent complaint of pressure detection not working, try
holding your pen still, increase and reduce pressure on the tip repeatedly,
and see if the reports change in sync with that. You should see some bytes in
the reports go up as you increase the pressure:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>003:006:000:STREAM             1474197596.184651

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And go down as you decrease it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>003:006:000:STREAM             1474197596.822554

 07 80 DB 85 98 1F 00 00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note also that with any pen input it is very hard to keep the pen completely
still and so reported pen coordinates will almost always change with anything
else you’re trying to do, such as varying the pressure. Can you see the
pressure changing in the reports above? Try finding it.</p>

<p>Yes, it is the last two bytes. In most cases this is where the pressure is.
In some very rare cases, where the tablet actually supports reporting tilt
angles (I only ever saw one such non-Wacom tablet), they will follow pressure.</p>

<p>Don’t be discouraged if you don’t see the tablet responding to the input
you’re trying to make. It can still be the case, that Linux simply doesn’t
initialize tablet properly and it doesn’t e.g. report pressure, or clicks on
the buttons around the drawing area. To rule <strong>that</strong> out you will have to
test with Windows.</p>

<p>If you’re <strong>sure</strong> Linux supports your tablet and you still don’t see the
reaction to the input, or it doesn’t work on Windows despite your best
efforts, then your tablet hardware is likely at fault and you’ll need to send
it for repair or replacement. Otherwise, proceed to the next section.</p>

<h2 id="kernel-drivers">Kernel drivers</h2>

<h3 id="debugfs-interface">Debugfs interface</h3>

<p>The kernel drivers can be buggy, or simply don’t know about your tablet. To
see if that’s the case, we can look at the kernel debug interfaces under
/sys/kernel/debug/hid.</p>

<p>First, become root:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo su -
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then go to /sys/kernel/debug/hid directory:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd /sys/kernel/debug/hid
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>List all files there:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ls -l
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will likely see a couple directories. Each HID interface on a USB device
will have a separate directory:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@gimli:/sys/kernel/debug/hid# ls -l
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Oct 29 19:42 0003:046D:C016.0001
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Oct 30 14:39 0003:256C:006E.000E
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Oct 30 14:39 0003:256C:006E.000F
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Oct 30 14:39 0003:256C:006E.0010
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The directory names consist of four hexadecimal numbers separated by colons.
First number is the bus ID (3 for USB), second number is device VID, third
number is device PID, and the fourth and last number is the HID interface
number, which is incremented with each connected device. If you disconnect
your tablet and connect it again it will get different HID interface numbers.</p>

<p>In the example above the first directory belongs to a USB mouse, and the other
three belong to a <a href="/tablets/Huion_H610/">Huion H610</a> tablet. Each of the directories
contains two files, <code class="highlighter-rouge">rdesc</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">events</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@gimli:/sys/kernel/debug/hid/0003:256C:006E.000E# ls -l
total 0
-r-------- 1 root root 0 Oct 30 14:39 events
-r-------- 1 root root 0 Oct 30 14:39 rdesc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are not regular files, but instead contain data generated by the kernel
as you read them. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">rdesc</code> file will contain the interface HID report
descriptor and its interpretation by the kernel, which is useful, but is
hard to interpret, and we’d better focus on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">events</code> file.</p>

<p>When you read the <code class="highlighter-rouge">events</code> file, the kernel will be outputting the stream of
input reports it reads from the device and how it interpreted them, without
end. However, this is done only if something actually reads from the
corresponding device. If you have no user-space drivers handling this device,
you might as well see nothing in <code class="highlighter-rouge">events</code> file. In that case, running <code class="highlighter-rouge">evtest</code>
on the corresponding event device (see below), will fix it.</p>

<p>As before, you might need to try reading the <code class="highlighter-rouge">events</code> file for each device and
do some input to find the device directory you need. That, or look at and
interpret the contents of the corresponding <code class="highlighter-rouge">rdesc</code> file. Here is an example
output for the pen interface of the same Huion H610:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@gimli:/sys/kernel/debug/hid/0003:256C:006E.000E# cat events 

report (size 8) (numbered) =  07 80 a3 62 c9 3b 00 00
Digitizers.TipSwitch = 0
Digitizers.BarrelSwitch = 0
Digitizers.TabletPick = 0
Digitizers.InRange = 1
GenericDesktop.X = 25251
GenericDesktop.Y = 15305
Digitizers.TipPressure = 0

report (size 8) (numbered) =  07 80 9c 62 b6 3b 00 00
Digitizers.TipSwitch = 0
Digitizers.BarrelSwitch = 0
Digitizers.TabletPick = 0
Digitizers.InRange = 1
GenericDesktop.X = 25244
GenericDesktop.Y = 15286
Digitizers.TipPressure = 0

report (size 8) (numbered) =  07 80 99 62 bb 3b 00 00
Digitizers.TipSwitch = 0
Digitizers.BarrelSwitch = 0
Digitizers.TabletPick = 0
Digitizers.InRange = 1
GenericDesktop.X = 25241
GenericDesktop.Y = 15291
Digitizers.TipPressure = 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above is truncated to just three reports, you will get much more than that
with a pen interface of your tablet.</p>

<h3 id="evtest-tool">Evtest tool</h3>

<p>Another approach is to see what the tablet looks like through the evdev
interface, which userspace drivers use. Make sure you have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">evtest</code>
package installed, and then run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">evtest</code> tool:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo evtest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It will present you with the choice of devices to test. Something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nick@gimli:~$ sudo evtest

<p>Your tablet can be represented by several devices: one for pen input, another
for frame buttons, a third one for the mouse, if it has one, and so on. In the
output above the tablet interfaces are listed last and are clearly labeled,
thanks to the work of Benjamin Tissoires on the UC-Logic driver. Other tablets
might not be so well catered-for, so you might need to figure out which one is
which and select appropriately. Otherwise you can simply try them one-by-one
until you find the one that produces output when you do the kind of input
you’re trying to troubleshoot.</p>

<p>Enter the device number and you will be presented with a list of events and
value ranges the corresponding interface can report, followed by endless
output of events the kernel reports. Example for Huion H610 pen interface:</p>

<p>As mention before, pen interfaces produce a lot of events, and the above is
just a short snippet.</p>

<h3 id="in-any-case">In any case</h3>

<p>Look at the produced output and try to see if it makes sense, e.g. if the pen
movement affects appropriate axes fully, button clicks make sense, etc.</p>

<p>If you think the output you see is wrong, report your problem to the bug
tracker of your Linux distribution. If that fails, report it to the kernel
bugtracker at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/.</p>

<p>If the output looks right to you, move on to the next section.</p>

<h2 id="userspace-drivers">Userspace drivers</h2>
<p>If you use the still most popular X.org display server, you’re likely using
either xf86-input-evdev or the newer xf86-input-libinput drivers. You can also
be using the xf86-input-wacom driver, but only if you set it up yourself, in
which case you would know. Unfortunately, I cannot help you if you use Mir or
Wayland, as I haven’t used them myself yet. Refer to their documentation and
support forum.</p>

<p>To test the X.org drivers you will need the <code class="highlighter-rouge">xinput</code> tool, usually available
in the package by the same name. First, find out your device name. Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">xinput
list</code> to see all devices. They will look similar to what you get from the
evdev output and you can use the same approach to find the one you need: read
the device names, and if several look like what you need, try them one by one
by supplying their name or IDs to <code class="highlighter-rouge">xinput test</code> command, and then doing the
appropriate input until it produces output.</p>

<p>Here is an example for Huion H610:</p>

<p>Look at the output and try to figure out if it makes sense. If something looks
not right, like wrong axes reported for pen movement, or wrong scan codes
reported for button presses, then report your problem at bugtracker of your
Linux distribution (you know where to find it, right?). If that fails, report
your problem at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/</p>

<p>If everything looks right, move on to the next section.</p>

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>If you see problems with your tablet in all applications you try, then you
need to check previous sections. Otherwise, make sure your application is
configured correctly. Although not strictly necessary, many applications
provide interface for configuring tablet usage and sometimes that needs
adjusting. Look at the corresponding application configuration and
documentation and check our (now rather outdated, but still useful)
<a href="/support/#application-setup">application setup HOWTOs</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/support/howto/trbl/locating_failure/gimp_input_setup.png" alt="GIMP input setup dialog" /></p>

<p>Some applications even provide a way to test the way they understand your
tablet, such as MyPaint. That can help you.</p>

<p><img src="/support/howto/trbl/locating_failure/mypaint_input_test.png" alt="MyPaint menu option for input device testing" /></p>

<p>If you still can’t figure it out, check if you only get problems in
applications using the same toolkit, i.e. GTK or Qt.  Both of them had issues
with tablet support in the past and that can happen again, especially since
most people test with Wacom tablets only. If you can confirm that, report the
issue with the corresponding toolkit to your Linux distribution bug tracker,
or if that fails, to the bug tracker of the specific toolkit.</p>

<p>Otherwise, report an issue with the specific application to your
distribution’s bug tracker, or to the bug tracker of the application itself.</p>
